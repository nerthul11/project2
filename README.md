# Project 2 - Flack

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is also a CS50 project, where the goal is to create a functional Chat site. This code allows to interact with the site by:
-Logging in and out.
-Create chatrooms both public and private, and also search one to join it.
-Stores up to 5 (will be 100, but still at 5 for testing purposes) messages per chatroom.
-You can edit the background color for any page.
-Has a bingo mini-game as an added feature.
